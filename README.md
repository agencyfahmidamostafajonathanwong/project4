Description - Simplified take on Yugi Oh Card Game.

Initial setup- Player gets 5 random cards, "Computer" gets random 5 cards.

Each player gets 2000 life points.
Each card has a defense and attack value.

Player and computer get 1 attack per turn or choose to turn card to defense. If card is defense you must attack.

Monsters can only kill monsters with lower attack points. Remaining attack points are removed from player life. AKA. if Monster A has 800 atk and monster B has 500 atk. Opposing player takes 300 damage.

When all monsters are dead. Player may be attacked directly.
